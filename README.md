Project URL: <a href="https://faozio.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/">Rock, Paper, Scissors</a>

Usage:
<ul>
<li>Depending on when you are viewing this project, the initial project can only be tested using the console. Much later, an interface would be added.</li>
<li>The game is played with three possible inputs that represent a rOcK, PaPer, and SciSSorS. (Note: Case sensitivity is not considered)</li> 
<li>Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins against paper.</li>
<li>For each player input, the computer also randomly outputs it's own selection</li>
<li>The winner is noted for each round with the player/computer score updated</li>
<li>If both user and computer select the the same outcome, it is considered a tie, and play resumes until it completes a five round stage.</li>
<li>Afterwards game ends with either "Player wins!", "Computer wins!" or "It's a tie!"</li>
</ul>
