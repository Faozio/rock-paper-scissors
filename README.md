Sure! Here's an updated version of the description with the project URL:

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" using JavaScript. The game allows you to play against the computer for five rounds and keeps track of the scores.

You can play the game by visiting the following URL: [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://faozio.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)

The game works as follows:

1. The game will prompt you to enter your choice for each round. Enter either 'rock,' 'paper,' or 'scissors' (case-insensitive) and press Enter.

2. After each round, the game will display your choice, the computer's choice, and the result of the round.

3. Once all five rounds are completed, the final result will be displayed, indicating whether the player or the computer won the game, or if it's a tie.

The code consists of the following main components:

- The `getUserChoice` function prompts the user to enter their choice and validates the input.

- The `getComputerChoice` function generates a random choice for the computer.

- The `playRound` function determines the result of a single round based on the player and computer choices.

- The `game` function orchestrates the gameplay by running five rounds, updating the scores, and displaying the results.
